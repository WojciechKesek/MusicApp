# MusicApp
This application was my first exposure to databases

I wrote it as part of an online course and I later expanded it during my training journey.

The core purpose of this application is to simplify song list management by leveraging database operations

The user-friendly functionalities include:
- Displaying a list of artists
- Displaying a list of albums for a specific artist
- Displaying a list of albums that contain a specific song
- Displaying quantities in the database of:
  -  artists,
  - albums,
  - songs
- Adding songs
